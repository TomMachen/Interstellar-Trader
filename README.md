# Interstellar-Trader
A game about trading goods in outer space! Reeeeal good fun!


I just uploaded all my old code, I used to do about 5 years ago. Today is the 19.06.21. I am sitting at my desk, in my own house (renting) in Dorset Southwest England. I would no longer consider myself a computer programmer, as such. Now I do product design and various other things. However, maybe I should get back into it, maybe I will. No, don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with it. However, I haven't been as active lately. 

Anyway, back to the best code you have ever seen! Yes you will give me all of your money, whomever you are! Nah, it's a console game, about trading goods in outer space basically. Imagine you are on the interstellar stock market. A banker, fintech (financial technology) if you will. This is under GNU, any updates, designs, heck I'll even take photos, can be emailed to dialling@tommachen.com. 

There is some source somewhere, but I have to dig it out. Of my datadrive, cloud drive thingy magig. Yes, I am English, and proud, a patriot. 

The problem is I was crafting as I went along. Anyways, you can even call me on 0044 7584 828 983. We will chat. It's open source so Apple get on it right now! And swing a sweet looking desktop my way. On the double. 

In all seriousness, I would be interested to see what people think. So look me up, or just have fun. 

Well, I guess there's only one thing to say right...hello world!
